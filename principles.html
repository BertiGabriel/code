Principles

Customer Obsession
Start with the customer's real problem and work backwards. Every decision, product, and interaction must create tangible value. Talk directly to users, listen carefully, and iterate based on concrete feedback.

Swift Execution
Prioritize speed over perfection. Launch minimum viable products quickly, test hypotheses with real customers, and iterate based on data. Make agile decisions, remembering that most of them are reversible.

Relentless Focus
Say "no" to almost everything. Concentrate limited resources only on what generates significant impact for customers and business. Eliminate distractions and pursue depth instead of breadth.

Owner's Mindset
Take complete responsibility for results. Think like a founder, acting beyond job descriptions and functional boundaries. Prioritize long-term business success over immediate gains.

Transparency and Adaptation
Share successes and failures openly. Constantly question assumptions, learn quickly from mistakes, and change direction when necessary. Value data and feedback above intuitions and personal preferences.
